The difference between serial and parallel is serial processing you take a list of items and do whatever you want to do with them one by one. 
It will take as long to complete the task as there are items in your list.
While parallel processing you have means of dividing your task among 2 or more processing units, processor cores for example, so the task will take (ideally) as long as #_of_items/#_of_processing_units to complete.
So Serial processing is a type of processing in which one task is completed. And parallel processing is a type of processing in which multiple tasks are completed at a time by different processors.
